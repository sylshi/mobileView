                <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
                <!-- 次标题 -->
                <h4>Stakeholders in the Group Purchasing Business Model</h4>
                <!-- 标题 -->
                <p class="content">As a startup project of DiDi that is designed to allow ​a group of residents within the same community to buy daily necessities together with less face-to-face contact and lower prices, DiDi Select has an average of 1.07 million daily active group leaders. While employed, I focused on improving the user experience of the app on the group leader's side.</p>

                <h2>In the group purchase business, we seek a high turnover rate to keep fresh foods in a good condition.</h2>
                <!-- 醒目总结 -->
                <p class="content">Group leaders are the last node on this chain. In order to enable the group leaders to timely notify their customers after receiving the daily goods, we provide the Function of Arrival Notification on the app.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>PROBLEM SCOPING</h3>
                <h4>I noticed through business data that the original Arrival Notice feature need to be optimized:</h4>
                <p class="title">1 Platform Loss</p>
                <p class="content">The after-sale rate of the products is 1.8%, among which 20% of the after-sale is caused by the damage of the products due to customers not picking up the goods in time,  the value of the products in this part accounts for 0.36% of the GMV.</p>
                <p class="title">2 Low Function usage</p>
                <p class="content">According to daily usage data, only 34.92% of the group leaders who have daily records of confirming receipt will use the Arrival Notification function.</p>
                <p class="title">3 3 Costomer Complaints</p>
                <p class="content">Customers' negative reviews for the group leaders consisted 2.03% of the total reviews, among which negative reviews tagged "Unresponsive Notifications" accounts for 31.84% of the total, ranking the top 2 complaints.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>USAGE DATA ANALYSIS & USER INTERVIEW</h3>
                <h4>I dug into user habits through online questionnaires and user interview</h4>
                <p class="content">According to the results of the questionnaire, 64.7% of the group leaders will send the arrival notice immediately after they finished the inventory. The main reasons for not using the function are their different habits in notifying their customers and the cumbersome operations process of the function.</p>
                <img src = "image/research.png" alt = "research result based on the online questionnaire. Over 50% of the group leaders use the Arrival Notice function every day. the reason why those who don't use the function is they thought the funtion takes too many steps to send the notification." width="200"/>
                <h4>I further gathered group leaders' feedback on this feature</h4>
                <img src = "image/interview picture.png" alt = "interview pictures took at the group leaders' places" width="200"/>
